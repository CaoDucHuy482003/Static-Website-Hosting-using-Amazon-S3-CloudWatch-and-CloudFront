Amazon CloudWatch is a monitoring and observability service provided by AWS, allowing you to collect, track, and analyze logs, performance metrics, and events from AWS resources as well as applications running on cloud or on-premises. With CloudWatch, users can easily monitor system health, set up alarms for incidents or threshold breaches, and visualize real-time data through dashboards.

CloudWatch plays an important role in ensuring performance, quickly detecting errors, and supporting efficient system operations, especially in serverless or microservices architectures such as AWS Lambda, API Gateway, EC2, and ECS.

- Benefits of using CloudWatch:

  + Real-time system monitoring

  + Automatic alerts for incidents

  + Reduce error detection time

  + Fast debugging via logs

  + Easy integration into CI/CD and serverless systems
