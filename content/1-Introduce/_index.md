This workshop will guide you to build, deploy, and monitor a **full-stack e-commerce application** using ReactJS combined with AWS services such as **S3**, **CloudFront**, and **CloudWatch**. This is a modern fashion e-commerce application — fully featured with shopping, order management, discount codes, customer support chat, and notification management.

You will learn how to integrate the React frontend, deploy the backend, upload product images to S3, deliver content quickly via CloudFront, and monitor user activity with CloudWatch.

The main benefits you will gain from this workshop:

- Understand how to use S3 to store product images and host the static frontend.
- Configure CloudFront to accelerate global website delivery.
- Integrate AWS CloudWatch to monitor activity and check for errors.
- Deploy an automatic discount system based on order conditions.
- Create an admin dashboard to manage products, orders, and customers.
- Develop the entire system with ReactJS + Tailwind + optimized LocalStorage.
- Manage user state, notification popups, and chat with admin.

By the end of the workshop, you will have built and deployed a full-stack e-commerce application with best practices in tracing and monitoring—ready for scaling and production.
